# Paradise-Hotel
Full-Stack Hotel reservation system built with Spring Boot RESTful API and AngularJS2

Thank you for your interest in my project and for openning this file :)

In order to start the back-end part please make sure that you have java 8 (JRE) (https://java.com/download) and Gradle build tool installed (https://gradle.org/install/).
After that in the command prompt in the project root directory run the following bootRun task: "gradle bootRun"
The server will start on port 8080 by default. In order to run it on different port run the following: "gradle bootRun -Dserver.port=[some_port]"
In order to start front-end part make sure to have angular installed (https://www.npmjs.com/package/angular).
From Paradise-Hotel/src/main/webapp/angular2/ run "ng serve" and navigate to http://localhost:4200/
That's it. You don't need to deploy it into any servlet container. Tomcat is already embedded in the jar file as well as H2 in-memory database.

For any comments or suggestions please write to my personal email: mgaievski87@gmail.com

Kind regards,
Maksym Gaievskyi
